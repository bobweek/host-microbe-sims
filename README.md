# host-microbe-sims

This repository contains code for simulating a microbiome-explicit model of host trait evolution mediated by host-associated microbiome transmission. The file _simulating_scripts/defs.jl_ is the engine of this project, containing definintions for model dynamics, data structures, and functions that prepare data for visualization.
